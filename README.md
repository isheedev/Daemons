🩸 Daemons — A Retro Boomer Shooter Built in Unity

Stylized retro visuals – Chunky pixels, dynamic lighting, and gritty shaders that bridge 90s nostalgia with modern rendering.

Smart AI & combat design – Enemies that swarm, flank, and punish hesitation.

Heavy atmosphere – Pulse-pounding metal soundtrack and sound design that makes every encounter visceral.
